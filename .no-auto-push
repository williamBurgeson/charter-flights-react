DO NOT PUSH AUTOMATICALLY

This repository contains a marker file to indicate that automated agents should
not attempt to push changes to any remote without explicit human permission.

Policy: Do not run `git push` or allow tools to push unless you intentionally
remove this file or explicitly allow the push (see .git/hooks/pre-push).
